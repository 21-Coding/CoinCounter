Part 1
Create a coin counter function that uses recursion to solve the problem.

Part 2
Create a coin counter function that uses a closure that can be used with functions for each type of change (quarters, nickels, dimes and pennies).


const change = [1,5,10,25,100,500,1000];
$4.99
499

return results[100, 100, 100, 100, 25, 25, 25, 10, 10, 1, 1, 1, 1]
